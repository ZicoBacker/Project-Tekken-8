                    <p>Tekken 8 is very much Tekken, exactly like you've always known it. Luckily the game knows how to get maximum gain out of seemingly minimal additions, like the flashy Rage Arts, tactical Power Crushes and surprisingly spectacular presence of Street Fighter icon Akuma.</p>

                    <p>Tekken 7 is the epic conclusion to the Mishima family feud. The game looks great, is fully loaded with characters and offers a lot of modes. And it plays like a charm. It has some minor flaws, but nonetheless this is simply a must-buy.</p>
